For single cell RNA seq data, what are the distribution of the raw data? Does it depend on the patient, sample, tissue type, cell type, etc? The content below may answer this question.

# Does freezing affect the quality of the scRNA seq data?

# What is the efficiency of current scRNA-seq protocols?

# What are the techniques to preprocess scRNA-seq data, and why are they used?
