Let's start with some normal text, and then change to another paragraph.

This line will be followed by a header.

#This is the first header.
##This is a smaller header.

The following is called a blockquote.

> Here it is, the first line of this blockquote.
>
> The second line is empty. This is the third line.

##This is another small header, there is no dot at the end :)
