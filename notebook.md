# 2021-03-12. How to benchmark properly
To benchmark an algorithm in term of running time, I can use the package bench. I can use mark or press function to time the algorithm for one or a grid of parameters. It is usual practice to create a function using mark function to evaluate with individual parameter. Then one can incoporate this function with press function to create the evaluation across different parameters. 

For this  purpose, the reference is the book Advanced R second edition, chapter about name and value.
